* I want to order cheese pizzas ($6) and see the total cost of my order
* I want to order pepperoni pizzas ($7)
* I want to add these ingredients ($1) to a cheese pizza: pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, green pepper, sausage, ham, olives, beef
* I want to order a large pizza ($9) with any ingredients ($2)
* I want a Deluxe pizza (pepperoni, onions, mushroom, green pepper, and sausage), medium for $9 and large for $15
* I want to order ingredients on only half the pizza. The cost for ingredients is the same as the side with the most ingredients
* I want to be able to order extra amounts of an ingredient (at double price), including double cheese which costs $2 for a medium and $3 for a large
* I want to order a Super Deluxe pizza (pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, green pepper, sausage, ham, olives, beef), medium for $12 and large for $20
* I want to order a pizza without some ingredients that it normally has (sauce, cheese, Deluxe). This does not change the price of the pizza.
